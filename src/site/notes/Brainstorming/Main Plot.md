#setup 

> I prefer a structured plot progression over something. There needs to be a *tangible goal* in sight for my characters to accomplish. 

- Retrieve the three weapons and restore the consciousness of the God in the axe. This might give our protagonists **more answers** before the Armageddon proceeds and humans are wiped out… 
	- 1: Found at a dusty old library in Naunapocia, effectively abandoned. 
	- 2: Steal the weapon from North Ibounsterig. Well— they *try* to, but soon learn that the weapon is well-protected and they might as well use other methods to obtain it. 
	- 3: Steal it from someone who actually knows what it is. They run into a lot of trouble…
		- They bought it from an auction. 
	- 4: The last weapon is in possession of the royal army of a certain kingdom. MC/Mara/LI has to fight one of the elite fighters to get the weapon for themselves. 
	- Then, the betrayal is announced? But a betrayal can’t be too obvious, though. 

## Key Discovery

> Much of the story hinges on this truth…

## Other Goals

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">People who have circumvented prophecies</mark>. Can MC find any  such person? — <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">[[Meta/Defying Fate\|Defying Fate]]</mark>
	- Did not actively try to learn more about this, rather what happens happens by chance…
	- MC has his fortune done by a famous <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Su Am fortuneteller</mark>, who freaks out… 
- What is the identity/origin of the twins? — <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">[[Characters/Protagonist Backstory\|Protagonist Backstory]]</mark>
	- The information should be revealed gradually. 
	- First, it should be made evident that they belong to a Family of some kind, which is why they are able to manipulate Eff.
	- Second, the two meet Jou and his mysterious Dad. *Jou* learns the truth before everyone else does. 
- Monauka’s up to some evil shit. — <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">[[Writing/Script/Monaukan New World Order\|Monaukan New World Order]]</mark>
	- The axe reacts strongly, almost becoming rogue. MC also becomes really really angry when hearing about these injustices. 
	- It turns out, the world is *pretty* evil, and a lot of evil stuff is going on right now. 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Can the gang use the Tome of Sacrifice to call upon the essence of Eff?</mark> Or, get more answers in general?
	- Give up what makes you human. Surrender your body to Eff. Then, pay the unthinkable price. Only then will the Gods acknowledge your presence.
