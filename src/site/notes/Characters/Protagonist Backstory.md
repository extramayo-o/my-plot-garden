#character #setup #spoiler

- Some insane cultists began a very, very unethical series of magical experiments to expedite the creation of the “savior”— *on their own terms.*
	- In their version of the religion, the “savior” is a God themselves who grants the cultists eternal life… Or I feel, it should be similar to that, in terms of desirability or insane-ness. 
		- ? Godhood?
		- ? Or just plain vanilla “eternal life”?
- Scandal was eventually revealed to the public, causing immediate international outrage. 
- However, the experiments actually succeeded… Somewhat. 
- ! Before the government takes them for their crimes, the cultists repent by dousing themselves in fire and begging their savior for repentence. In the midst of this fiery incident,  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a mysterious researcher takes MC and Mara and rescues them from the fire</mark>, knowing what they are. 
	- Now SHE is the one who wants Godhood/Eternal Life, all for herself. But her plans are thwarted when MC and Mara run away from home and become virtually untraceable. 
	- Even better <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">if she threw everyone under the bus!</mark> Twist villain?
