“In the beginning, there was Eff. At the core of our world is a primitive being that is Eff itself—the Essence of Eff. To this day, scientists are uncertain of what Eff is, but you can understand of it as an *extradimensional form of energy.*

“Eff began to flood the planet. From the surface of the earth it began to flow into bodies of physical nature—the trees, the air, the grass. Thousands of years passed and Eff became integrated with the world. To the point where Eff became super condensed, and began to have a *mind of its own*. 

“Indeed, Gods were made *after Eff*, not the other way around. It took Naunapocian researchers a while to figure *that* one out, haha.” He pauses and regains composure. “Anyways, Gods were beings made of Eff that *used* Eff to liven up the land. They made organisms and life forms, including human beings. And the Essence of Eff, that primordial being, eliminated those beings that stepped out of line. That had too much power in the world.

“When the Gods made human beings, it was to challenge the natural order of the world. But they soon realized that they themselves had gone too far. These intelligent beings overpowered all other life forms of the land. They created hierarchies and made societies and then excluded people from them, all in the name of survival of the fittess. They were ruthless, but they were *intelligent*.

“They were next to be eliminated by the Essence of Eff, due to disrupting the natural order of the land. But, the Gods had taken quite a liking to these beings, seeing their ability to be smart, caring, and compassionate.

“As Eff became more and more toxic to human beings, the situation grew more desperate— and so these Gods decided to protect their creation by fighting the Essence of Eff itself at the core of the earth.[^1]

“Twelve Gods—whom we now acknowledge as the “major Gods”—led the charge. Despite their efforts, they were wiped out by the Essence of Eff. However, in a miraculous last stand, four of the strongest-willed Gods made a final assault, greatly crippling the Essence of Eff. 

“For 500 years it has slumbered as the human race has continued to progress without major harm. Of course, we know that one day, the Essence of Eff will stir again and come back to finish the mass extinction of human beings… But thankfully, the Oracle in Strie Cral has responded to our cries. We know that there will be a savior who will come to bravely give their life and defeat the Essence of Eff once and for all… And that they are one among us… So the human race will not be obliterated and there is nothing for us to worry about…”

The wind roars against the steps of the building. The old man lets out a big sigh. His audience is long-lost. Do these people have no appreciation for a good old-fashioned history lesson anymore? But it’s not their fault for leaving prematurely—this is a long-exhausted story the world over, after all. 

He doesn’t know it, but his actual “audience” are on the other side of the wall—two disinterested young adults, both furiously digging through papers and documents galore while being mercilessly subjected to his storytelling.

[^1]: I have an issue with this portion because I’m omitting my own creation myth story so that the reader won’t be overwhelmed with more information… Should I just add the whole thing in? It seems like a pain to explain more details later… BUT IF IT MAKES SENSE RIGHT NOW, I can do that.
