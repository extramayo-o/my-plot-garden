## Soldier Scuffle

- Axe: “You see, that sign reads: “The Oracle belongs to Cralians”. That sign over there reads: “Foreigners Unwelcome.”
- Mara: “… Axy, do you think we look like Cralians?”

> Mara and Seth don’t even know the country that they came from. Nothing from their appearance indicates that they *belong* to a certain country—although it *might* disqualify a few of them. Even their eye color didn’t give them any hints. Their eyes were bright orange, which probably indicated some demigod heritage but not enough to manifest in other traits that demigods typically had. For all they knew they could be descended from any Family in the world. 

- Axe: “Not a chance.”
- Mara: “What gives?”
- Axe: “Well first, your clothes.”

> The two look down at their clothes. They are tattered, stained, and made of a Naunapocian cloth material designed to cool down its wearer. Certainly not suitable for a coastal climate. 

- MC: “She meant our…” Seth waves a hand over his and Mara’s face. 
- Axe: “You two are still tanned from your stay in Naunapocia. Unlike the Cralians, who look like they barely get any sun.”
- Mara: “Dammit. I was hoping we could pass as Cralian.”
- MC: “He’s probably right though.”
- Mara: “But, we can’t even *read* anything on the signs, and we barely understand them anyways. Even if we did pass as Cralian, we wouldn’t have made it far. Past *that*, anyways.”

> Mara points to a large crowd of people adorned in dark-colored robes. Many of the people seem to be young. They are talking amongst themselves while standing on the steps to the entrance of the Temple. 

- MC: “There has to be a way in somehow. Maybe we can get those people to sneak us in willingly.”
- Mara: “They’re Cralian monks, Seth. Hell would freeze over before one of them *let us* in the temple.”
- MC: “… Then we don’t have to interact with them at all! We can hide in a barrel, or some shipping compartment, and then sneak ourselves in the door, no questions asked.”
- Mara: *Smiles slightly.* “Now that’s a much better suggestion, Seth. But what can we use for that?”
- MC: “We should look around… Maybe the temple has another entrance. One where they bring in food or offerings, perhaps?”

 > The two begin to walk. 
 
- Soldier: “Hey, what are you doing here? The Temple’s closed to foreigners!”

> A soldier marches up to the two twins in a white horse, again pointing his blade at Mara’s neck.

- Mara: “Damn!”
- Soldier: “What did you say to me, you brat?”

> Seth steps in front of Mara, putting space between her and the blade.

- MC: “She didn’t say anything.”
- Soldier: “Don’t lie to me, you foreigner brat. I heard her swear at me; indignation towards a Holy Knight is punishable by death.”

> Seth grabs the axe in his hand and feels it “depower”.

- MC: “She wasn’t speaking to you.”

> The soldier scoffs, and spits on Seth. 
> Though Seth’s arms shake, his resolve hardens as he stares at the Knight through his helmet. His hand grips tightly around the axe. The needle of the compass moves slowly towards the top, but not fully.  

- Soldier: “And I wasn’t going to kill *you*, but I guess I am now.”
- MC: “Go on! Do it, you bastard!”

> The knight snarls in his helmet. 

- Mara: “Wait!”
- There is little reaction from either side.
- Mara: “Today is not the day where you spill blood!”

> The soldier stops completely. 

- Mara: “… ”
- Soldier: “… HAHAHA!”
- Soldier: “Are you suggesting that I would fall in battle?”
- Mara: “No, I’m saying that this battle wasn’t fated to happen.”

> This is an insane gambit on Mara’s part. 
> Mara gulps silently. The people on the steps have quieted to look at the scene before them. 

- Mara: “… And you wouldn’t go against your fate, right?”
- Soldier: “… You dare invoke the name of the Oracle?”
- Mara: “Yes! Yes, I dare!”
- Soldier: “… Very well. I will have the Head Teller ask the Oracle right now, if I am meant to kill you two today. If your *telling* is incorrect, then we shall have a deathmatch in the city square. *Without your weapon.*”

> The crowd at the entrance of the Temple parts slightly to reveal a figure in dark purple. She looks slightly older than the rest of the crowd. She nods at the soldier, and heads inside of the Temple. 

>The soldier sneers at the two. 

- Soldier: “Enjoy your last moments of living.”

> Mara smiles to herself, and then she can’t hold it in anymore. She laughs and laughs to herself and watches as the crowd looks at her, mumbling to themselves. 

> Seth is sweating and anxious. He put his life on the line to protect his sister and was very nearly about to fight. The needle shifts back to its neutral position, and Seth feels a tingle through his veins as Axe’s voice reforms in his mind. 

- Axe: “Can you hear me?”
- MC: “Yeah!” Seth blurts aloud.
- Axe: “If you can hear me, that means I can hear your thoughts, Seth.”
- MC: “Right.”
- Axe: “Seth, what you did just now was extraordinary.”
- MC: “… I just did what a good brother would do.”
- Axe: “No, I’m not talking about that. Though that *was* seriously brave of you— I commend you, Seth. You’re a great brother. But, no, I’m talking about how you used me, as a weapon.”
- MC: “What do you mean?”
- Axe: “Earlier now, did you hear the Moral Compass turn?”
- MC: “Oh, yeah. I felt the weapon grow powerful in my hands.”
- Axe: “Yup. *That’s* what’s extraordinary about you, Seth. The Will of Justice responded to your situation, and you were able to wield the weapon, even use it in battle.”
- MC: “So you’re saying, *I was able to use the axe as a weapon.*”
- Axe: “Precisely.”
- MC: “But… Isn’t the axe powered with Eff? And a lot of it, too. It’s one of the four weapons to deal the final blow, after all…”
- Axe: “It just means you have enough demigod blood for your body to not *reject* the Eff in the weapon, Seth.”
- MC: “*Enough,* huh.”
- MC: “Axy… Maybe I *am* a Demigod. Maybe I’m even part of a Family. Or royalty!”
- Axe: “It could be, since Mara is your twin sister, after all. And it could also be that you find out while you’re on this journey.”
- MC: “…”
- MC: “… You know, back when I was in Monauka, I trained with weapons *a lot*.”
- MC: “I really wanted to become an elite soldier… To join the Monaukan army, and to eventually use a Eff weapon…”
- MC: “Who knew I would be using one *now*? And that I would be able to use one without years of *training*, anyways?”
- Axe: “Seems like it worked out in the end, Seth.”

> The Head Teller exits the Temple. The Soldier dismounts the horse and walks towards her. 

- Soldier: “Glad you’re back, madame. How did the Telling go?”

> The Head Teller’s face looks pale. 

- Soldier: “Ah, if it’s too gory, you can spare the details, madame.”
- Teller: “No. She was… She was right.”

> The crowd murmurs and the soldier becomes silent. 

- Teller: “She was not meant to fight you today. That’s all the Oracle told me. It refused to tell me anything more.”
- Teller: “If you may… Please sheathe your sword, good sir. They have declared that it would not be drawn today.”

> The soldier tucks it away into his sheathe as he dumbfoundedly mounts his horse. 

- Soldier: “Yes, High Priestess.”
- Teller: “And you two… Please come with me.”

> Seth tucks the axe on the leather strap around his back instead of pulling out the black box. The two stand up and walk to the Teller. 

- Teller: “Are you a Teller yourself?”

> The whole crowd pauses to hear Mara’s response. 

- Mara: “Yes.”

> The crowd begins to murmur again. 

- Teller: “Incredible… May I see you closer?”

> Mara obliges. Seth realizes that the woman is blind. 

- Teller: “I sense a great, great amount of Eff from you, dear… Enough Eff to rival the prowess of my greatest student.”
- Mara: “Thank you, ma’am.”
- Teller: “Is that what brings you to Strie Cral? You smell like… a foreigner, if I might say.”
- MC: “Ouch!”
- Mara: “Yes, ma’am. I’m here to Strie Cral to strengthen my Telling by consulting the Oracle, ma’am.”
- Teller: “Then, I will lead you inside to see the Oracle. There are questions you alone might answer.”
- Mara: “Thank you, ma’am.”

>The twins follow the Teller in as the crowd continues to chatter. Mara smiles smugly. The two begin to whisper to each other, and thankfully because of the chatter of the crowd behind them, their talk is kept private.

- Mara: “Saved your ass.”
- MC: “You did… But how’d you pull it off?”
- Mara: “I had to make a bit of a gamble.”
- Mara: “I bet that if you *did* go in battle, that you would lose and die.”
- MC: “Hey!!”
- Mara: “And that after *you* were killed in battle, I would probably also be killed by the soldier. Or at least, I would fail to escape.”
- Mara: “So from that, I just assumed that the battle was never meant to happen.”
- MC: “Oh. Lucky guess.”
- Mara: “No, not a lucky guess! A calculated, *strategic* guess that ended up in our favor.”
- MC: “Well, what if I could have won again him?”
- Mara: “What do you mean, “won against him”. You haven’t sparred in two years.”
- MC: “… The axe had activated. I felt the power of Justice surging in me, telling me that I had to protect you.”
- Mara: “…”
- Mara: “We probably wouldn’t have made it in, then… We would’ve been chased out of Strie Cral at best. Not *heading into their Holy Temple.*”
- MC: “Huh, you’re right.”
- Mara: “So betting on your incapability saved us in the end.” *She smiles again, smugly.*
- MC: “Hey! Don’t put it like that!”
- Student: “Hey you two! Mind if we talk?”

> The two look behind them. There is a student trying to catch up with the two.

- Student: “For you to tell fortunes without a ritual… You know how impressive that is, right?”
- Mara: “Really? Is is rare?”
- Student: “Yes, extremely! And for them to be *accurate* on top of that is almost unimaginable, especially for someone of… your age.”
- Mara: “Oh. I see!”
- Student: “You’re almost as good as Sucheata… No, you might even be *better* than her.” The student looks genuinely excited. “Where exactly are you from? Surely you didn’t grow up here, like Sucheata did.”
- Mara: “Uhhh…”
- MC: “We’re from Naunapocia”, Seth blurts. 
- Student: “Well, that explains the *clothing*. But I thought that Telling was considered taboo there.”
- MC: “She just did it anyways.”
- Student: “That’s incredible!”
- Student: “Anyways, since we’re almost there… Do you know why Madame Eris decided to let you in the temple?”
- Mara: “Not really.”
- Student: “She’s trying to get someone to Tell the identity of the Savior. That’s been her project for 40 years, ever since she first started telling. Because Savior-related prophecies are so hard to perform, the fortuneteller needs to be extremely powerful. Since she failed to Tell the identity of the Savior, she’s been cultivating talent so that someone *could* do that.”
- Student: “… And she thinks that you might have that ability.”

> Mara suddenly looks nervous.

- Student: “Well, there’s no pressure for you if you *can’t*! Even Sucheata couldn’t do that, even if she got pretty close. And plus, if you *did*, it would effectively signal the apocalypse and—”
- Mara: “Yeah. I don’t think I can.”

> The three are silent for a while. 

- Student: “… Do you have any tips on how to Tell without a ritual?”
- Mara: “Can’t help you sorry,” she says, while grabbing Seth by the hand and speeding up. 

## The Oracle

- Teller: “This is it… the entrance to the Oracle”.

> The siblings stare at a extra-large, ornate door. It’s in pristine condition. It stretches a great length before them and the lever to open the door is ornate and golden. 

- Teller: “I know you’re ready to go and meet the Oracle… But I ask that you let my students go before you.”
- Mara: “Yes, that’s fine ma’am. Will they go in alone?” 
- Teller: “I don’t accompany my students inside the Oracle. It’s not my fate to Tell.”
- Mara: “Then, my brother and I are free to do our thing alone?”

> The Teller hesitates, but nods. 

- Teller: “Of course.”

>…
>Mara and Seth watch students exit the Oracle doors one-by-one.

- Student B: “I didn’t get anything from the Oracle this time!”
- Student C: “Really? I got something, but it was a basic reading of my mood this week…”
- Student B: “Man, it’s hard to get a useful Telling…”
- Student D: “Anyone have a spare ritual candle? I ran out…”

> Soon, it looks like all the students are done. 

- MC: “I think they’re all done.”
- Teller: “Very well. At your leisure.”

>Mara and Seth open the door to the Oracle and proceed down a long hallway that smelled strongly of ritual candles.

- Axe: “Alright, I can finally speak again.”
- MC: “Oh, right. You should probably be seeing this, huh?”
- MC: “Oh… Wait. Do you even have eyes?”
- Axe: “So as long as we’re aligned, Seth, I can see everything you see.”
- MC: “And if I put you in the box…?”
- Axe: “… Then I can’t see anything.”
- MC: “Okay then. I’ll keep you out.”
- Mara: “… None of the Cralians seemed to notice the Axe.”
- MC: “Oh, right… Wouldn’t it be more noticeable, as one of the weapons of finality?”
- Axe: “Perhaps none of them recognized me? Wait, I don’t like where you’re going with this.”
- Mara: “… It’s too much a risk to keep it out.”
- MC: “Yeah, when we’re done with the, let’s put you in the box.”
- Mara: “I agree.”
- Axe: “… And I don’t!”

> The three cross the and arrive at a smaller door that’s completely black with golden embellishments.

- Mara: “This must be the entrance.”

> The room is pitch black, save for a few remaining candles that are about to burn out.

- MC: “I can’t even see two feet in front of my face.”
- Mara: “Hold on— Gahhh!”

> Mara kicks something really hard and staggers back.

- MC: “Umm, I hope you didn’t just kick the Oracle.”
- Mara: “… I better not have.”
- Mara: “… Although it would be *prettyy* funny, I’m not going to lie.”

> MC flicks Mara with a finger in reaction to her joke.
> Suddenly, the two hear a roar from the back of the room. 

- MC: “It’s going to speak!”

> Then, the light flickers on in the room.  

- MC: “*Really?* Then what’s with the candles?”
- Mara: “They’re really not for illumination. They just smell a lot.”
- Axe: “It’s for the ritual.”
- MC: “Oh. Then we have to do that?”
- Mara: “Let’s hope not.”

> The two look at the thing in the middle of the room. It’s like a window in the middle where a black curtain separates something large in the center from the three of them. It’s slightly elevated from the rest of them. The two would have to climb some steps to reach it.

- Mara: “Let’s go.”

> The two climb the steps and walk near the curtain, Seth leading the way. And as the twins step closer, a strange noise starts to emanate from behind the curtain. It grows louder and louder until it drowns out Mara and Seth’s confused cries.

- Oracle: “RETURNED, AT LAST…”
- Oracle: “AND WITH IT BRINGS CALAMITY AND DESTRUCTION…”
- Mara: “IT’S SO LOUD!”

> But, Seth can’t hear Mara, and can barely make out the words on her lips.

- Oracle: “INDEED… THE SAVIOR HAS FINALLY COME…”

>Mara’s eyes close as she takes a deep breathe. Seth squeezes the side of her arm and also takes a deep breathe.

> Mara yells a question at the oracle barely loud enough for Seth to hear. 

- Mara: “BUT WHAT AWAITS ME ON THIS JOURNEY?”
- Oracle: “… TO BRING TRUE FINALITY TO THE UNFINISHED WORK…”

> Mara’s brows furrow as she realize it had completely ignored her question. Wind around them howls, and the roar of the Oracle around them continues on. Light emanates from behind the curtain so that a crumpled sillouhette starts becoming visible.

- Mara: “FINE! I’LL JUST WAIT FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR SPIEL, THEN.”
- Oracle: “YOU WILL GO ON A JOURNEY OF ANSWERS BUT FIND NONE…”
- Oracle: “YOU WILL FIGHT AGAINST FATE BUT FIND YOURSELF IN ITS MERCY…”
- Oracle: “YOU WILL TRAVEL THE WORLD AND SEE MANY GREAT SIGHTS ON YOUR JOURNEY…”
- Oracle: “BUT WHEN TIME COMES… YOU WILL DRAW THE RITUAL BLADE AND SAVE HUMANKIND AT THE EXPENSE OF YOUR OWN SELF…”
- Oracle: “IN THE END, YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO ESCAPE THE WHIMS OF FATE, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU STRUGGLE…”
- MC: “Okay. Where to, next?”
- Oracle: “… THE NORTH…”

> The roar stops, the room dims to pitch black, even the smell of candlewax fades. The encounter is over and the Oracle has finished
