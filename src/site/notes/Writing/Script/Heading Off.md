- Mara: “Seth, wake up!”

> Mara shakes Seth’s body.

- MC: “Ughhhh.”

> Seth’s head is throbbing and his eyes have large dark circles under them. He didn’t get too much sleep tonight. 

- Mara: “We’re planning where to go first, and we have an idea of where to go now.”
- MC: “Huhh?”

> He sits up and he notices that the Axe is outside of the box again.

- MC: “Wha… What time is it.”
- Mara: “You’ve been awake for roughly 6 hours past sunrise.”
- MC: “Oh…”

> Mara gives himself a moment to compose himself and get standing. 

- MC: “You pulled it out.”
- Axe: “Hey, kid, I’m not an *it*.”
- MC: “So, what *are* you exactly? I’m curious.”
- Axe: “I’m likely a fragment of consciousness of one of the Gods who dealt the final blow against the Essence of Eff.”
- MC: “Too much too fast. I just woke up.”
- Mara: “Do you remember the four Gods—The Four—who dealt the final blow against the Essence of Eff?”
- MC: “Yeah.”
- Mara: “It’s saying that it’s a piece of consciousness ”
- Axe: “If my reasoning is correct, that should be true. However, since my consciousness is split into four, I can’t exactly remember *who* I am, or *what* I am. So let’s say my theory is correct.”
- MC: “We can’t take *anything* you say for certain, huh.”
- Mara smiles. 
- Axe: “If you want to be that stubborn about it, then sure, you don’t *have* to.”
	- Points himself towards Seth as if threatening him. 
- MC: “Soo… Why can you talk? And, can we actually use you?”
- Axe: “The reason I can talk… Is because of *this* part on me.”

> Seth looks closely at the axe. There is a weird engraved *thing* in the head of the axe before its sharp edge, with two arrows. 

- Axe: “It’s a moral compass.”
- MC: “A moral… What?”
- Mara: “Since it’s a weapon from the House of Justice, presumably one of the weapons that dealt the final blow against the Essence of Eff, it has a special ability. This axe has a “moral compass”, a component that allows the Sentience inside of the weapon to manifest a voice and give the user advice.”
- Axe: “… She means that there’s an empty part in the weapon that lets me talk.”
- Mara: “It’s common knowledge, but I know you skipped class a ton.”
- MC: “Glad you know that”, he grumbles.
- Mara: “He was too busy hanging out with Dalia all the time that he forgot to take basic Language lessons.”
- MC: “Shut up!”
- Mara: “Sore subject, huh?”
- MC: “… So, why are you so *snarky* if you’re supposed to be a moral compass?”
- Axe: “There are two reasons for that, Seth— Number one. It’s the language that’s most understandable to you two, and the one you feel the most comfortable with. I can talk in this voice— *pulls out Shakespearean language bible*—or even like this, if that is to your pleasing, sir. But that’s not something you two are comfortable with listening to. And my purpose is to *help* you two.” 
- Mara: “That means you can speak other languages, right?”
- Axe: “Absolutely. That’s just a built-in feature.” 
- Mara: “That’ll be really useful when we go around the world…”
- Axe: “… I *guess* I can be your interpreter, if need be. Anyways, Seth, reason two.”
- Axe: “It’s because a moral compass is supposed of the **will of Justice**. I encourage you to do things that stand for Justice, discourage you from things that stand against Justice, and when things are morally grey, I leave them for you to decide. That’s why I advocated for you to join Mara, but ultimately left the decision to Mara herself. So what you perceive as “snarky” is probably just me being assertive, as my role as the Will of Justice.”
- MC: “… So you are Justice themself?”
- Axe: “I wish I knew, Kid. But I have to play a double role right now. I’m both the moral compass inside this axe, as well as a fragment of a God’s Sentience, preserved inside this weapon forever. For all I know, I *could* be… But I’m hardwired to be a moral compass, so I don’t know that.”
- MC: “Interesting… I thought you were supposed to know more than us.”
- Mara: “Leave it alone, Seth, it can’t help its stupidity.”
- Axe: “I told you to not call me “it”! Anything else but that.” 
- MC: “Can I call you Axy?”
- Mara: “*Axy?*”
- Axe: “If it works for you, Seth.”
- Mara: “…Anyways, can we shift topics now? Me and the axe planned something out last night.”
- MC: “Yeah, go ahead.”
- Mara: “We’re planning to find the other three weapons involved in dealing the final blow, to recover the consciousness of Axy. So we can have a God by our side, and maybe get more answers about *how* to defeat the Essence of Eff.”
- Axe: “It’ll take an indefinite amount of time to do, but that’s okay as of now. Currently, there are no indications that the apocalypse is occurring.”
- MC: “Yeah, the prophecy did mention that there would be widespread human suffering, didn’t it.”
- Mara: “It could be that I *am* the chosen one… But the prophecy itself hasn’t activated yet. And maybe Axy’s right, and I *will* live a long life, and just be the savior of the world as a grandma.”
- Seth smiles. 
- MC: “I’d love to see that.”
- Mara: “Right, that’s the best case scenario. But let’s not keep our hopes up. For now,” she says, unfurling a large world map, “we’ve set our next destination.”
- MC: “Strie Cral? Why there?”
- Axe: “Mara is hoping to use the Oracle there to get some answers as to her future, and also where to go for the three weapons.”[^1]
- MC: “Oh, and since the Oracle has never been wrong with its predictions… That would pretty much be confirmation, huh.”
- Axe: “Yup—Mara, the savior, with no smidge of doubt.”

>Mara gulps.

- Axe: “It’s a very smart choice to go *there* as a first destination. I commend you, Mara.”
- MC: “So even you don’t know where the other three weapons are, huh.”
- Axe: “Right. But I *do* know that they each hold a small part of my scattered consciousness, whichever God I may be.”
- Mara: “You don’t even know that about yourself.”
- Axe: “I wish I did, Mara. But I guess I’ll know when we gather my fragments of consciousness. I’m just not certain yet.” 
- Mara: “Strie Cral awaits, I guess.”
- Axe: “Indeed.”
- MC: “Mara, which route are we taking? Obviously avoid the Northern route, so I guess we have to go through this passage here, and then through here? That looks like pretty far, though…”
- Mara: “If you look here, there’s a Terminal from the Southern border of Naunapocia, that leads directly into Strie Cral. So we’ll only have to travel through that.”
- MC: “A terminal? But…”
- Mara: “Don’t worry, we can afford it this time. Besides, there are cliffs over that side of Naunapocia”, she drags her finger over the raised edge of the border between Naunapocia and Strie Cral, “that makes it pretty difficult for us to get to Strie Cral without a Terminal, anyways.”
- MC: “Okay. So we just head South…”
- Mara: “… And take the terminal to the Oracle, right.”
- MC: “Sounds good. When do you want to leave?”
- Mara: “How about tomorrow?”
- MC: “Alright. Then, we should get packing.”

> Mara nods.

>- Dimensional Nexus / Terminal - travel to nexus via (gate, teleport). Nexus has gates going to many places, possibly every place. Find correct gate at nexus to travel to destination.
>- How about a Terminal with platforms that are animated with Eff.
