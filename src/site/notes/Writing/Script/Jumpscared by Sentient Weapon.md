> MC’s eyes flutter open. He and Mara sit in a manmade cave that overlooks the city. There’s a bench for people to sit, but the place has been abandoned. It was a rest site for travelers going through Naunapocia back in the day. 

- MC: “Ugh…”

> He rubs his eyes and sits up, looking at Mara. Mara’s awake; her eyes are open but she’s still in a sleeping position. She does not look like she got any sleep. 

- MC: “Good morning, Mara.”
- Mara: “Mhm.”
- MC: “… We’ve got some bread left from our grocery shopping yesterday… Want breakfast?”
- Mara: “Sure, I’ll take some flatbread. But as soon as I finish, we’re going to leave this town at once.”
- MC: “What? … We spent 3 weeks trying to get here, though!”
- Mara: “I have a bad feeling about this city. We *need* to leave.”

> Seth’s head spins. Leaving the city? Already? They had spent months trying to get here by themselves, passing through countries and wandering through grasslands and hills and getting chased out of nooks and crannies by shopkeepers. And sure, he hated looking through libraries or digging through old documents. But they were getting so much closer to finding the identity of their mysterious aunt… Was Mara ready to give up on that already, so soon? 

- MC: “…”
- MC: “Just so you know, what happened yesterday was probably because you were tired.”
- MC: “We were both tired, and someone must have played a trick on us! And they got us real good… haha.“
- Mara: “You’re not convincing.”
- MC: “Why do you say that?”
- Mara: “You keep on saying things you don’t fully believe in. I can tell from the look on your face.”

> Seth frowns. 

- MC: “I’m just trying to be positive. If your hallucination *was* real—and if you *were* The Savior—doesn’t the prophecy say that they face “countless tribulations” and “untold suffering“, for the price of the salvation of mankind? It would really suck if you had to do that.”
- Mara: “I know that… I know.”
- MC: “Not to mention, it wouldn’t make sense. The orphanage taught us that the Savior would be revealed upon the unification of the Four Families…”
- Mara: “That’s just what Monaukan religion says. In other countries it’s different. Like, in Blinevutana, they say that the savior is chosen by—”
- MC: “Ugh..”
- Mara: “Seth, it’s basic history!”
- MC: “And I failed history.”
- Mara: “Wait, what? You never told me this.”
- MC: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">“Hey. There’s a reason ”</mark>

> Mara laughs and Seth smiles, happy that her mood has improved. 

- MC: “… I’m okay with us leaving the city, as long as we head to the next. At least I don’t have to hold pages of ten-tonned dictionaries for you anymore.”
- Mara: “That’s good. No more worrying about this “savior” stuff.”
- MC: “Absolutely not!”
- Mara: “But in the meantime, we need to plan where we’re headed next. Let me pull out the ma—”

> Mara’s stomach grumbles. 

- Mara: “Um.”
- MC: “Here, have some bread.”

> The two enjoy an impromptu breakfast, but Seth catches something from the corner of his eye. 

- MC: “Did you just see something?”
- Mara, finishing her last bite of bread: “See what?”
- MC: “Like… an animal or something.”
- Mara: “An animal? This area’s a practically dead end for wildlife, though…”
- MC: “No? … Must’ve been my imagination…”

> Seth immediately regrets his sentence after saying it aloud. How many times now has he thought that sentence? It can’t bode well. It’s like a bad omen. 

- Mara: “…”

> Suddenly, something drops on top of the stone table the two are sitting around. It lets out a loud thud and the two siblings guard their faces, surprised. 

- MC: ”What the?”
- Mara: “…”

> As the literal dust clears, the two take a look at the item that dropped from the table. 

- MC: “Not this again.”
- Mara: “… No way…”

> On the table lies a shiny black box, unscathed despite its rough landing on the stone table. Instinctively, the twins know that it’s the same one as the one from last night. Both understand what it means. 

- MC: “The Box is Sentient.”
- Mara: “No way, no way, no way…”
- MC: “Which means… Maybe it’s being possessed by the Sentience of some trickster God! That’s why it nearly killed us just now.”
- Mara: “No, Seth, that’s not it. I think I know why it’s back.”
- MC: “No Mara, we still don’t know ye—”

> Mara opens the lid of the box hesitantly, and the light blinds the two again. But this time, the weapon inside of the box starts glowing strongly and twisting the air around it. You’ve seen this multiple times in comics; you know what I mean by this.

- MC: “Whoah…”

>The siblings watch as it ascends up into the air, aura growing stronger, and then suddenly, lets out a booming roar…

- Axe: *Speaks in ancient tongues in an echoing voice.*
- MC: “Ack!” — *Jumps away from the weapon in fear.*
- Axe: *Continues to speak in tongues.*
- MC: “Ugh, can you just— speak in Monaukan, for Gods’ sake!”
- Mara: “Nobody says that to a talking axe, Seth!”

> The weapon slowly stops speaking and pauses.

- Axe: *Shakespearean dialogue that I can’t write on account of not reading Shakespeare.*
- Mara: “THAT WORKED?”
- MC: “Now another language?”
- Mara: “… We speak it, dumbass. Ugh… If only I payed more attention in Language class…”

> The weapon becomes silent, its glow weakens, and after an extended pause, it speaks again.

- Axe: “How about now?”
- MC: “It speaks!”
- Axe: “So you understand me now, huh?”
- Mara: “We sure do…”
- Axe: “Great! My memory isn’t sharp, but it really feels like it’s been a while since I’ve talked to anyone. I’ve been sitting in that dusty-ass museum for what feels like centuries…”
- Axe: “Well, it probably has been! Stuck in a dusty box for so long that I’ve lost all concept of time, hahahaha!”

> The twins are stunned silent, completely out of words. 

- MC: “…You’re a weapon. You shouldn’t be talking.”
- Axe: “Now, now! That isn’t the nicest thing to say to someone, human. Don’t know you that they used to make shrines of me back in the day? You should show some respect for your elders!”

>The weapon tilts itself towards Seth as it speaks, almost jokingly. He instinctively backs away.

- Axe: “Oh, don’t worry— there’s no need to be *afraid* of me. I couldn’t even hurt you if I wanted to! In fact, I’m here to help you instead!”
- MC: “What help?”
- Axe: “I mean, what else could it be! I’m a talking axe. Did you think I came with you to help you do chores?”
- Mara: “… CAME with you?”
- Axe: “… The box doesn’t open for anyone. Raiders, invaders, overzealous historians. There have been many people who have *tried* to pry me open, but to no avail.” 
- Axe: “The box only opens for one person, and she happened to find me last night.”
- MC: “…”
- Mara: “But I don’t want any of this! I don’t want this “saving the world” bullcrap. Much less being the Savior.”
- Axe: “…”
- Axe: “But you can’t deny the truth when it’s so imminent upon you.”
- Axe: “Don’t you hear it inside your head?”
- Mara: “…!”
- Axe: “It’s the call of the God of Fate… telling you that it’s finally your time to actualize the prophecy. *Your* prophecy.”
- MC: “Mara, is this true?”
- Mara: “Ugh… Well, what if I refuse to do any of this!”
- Axe: “…”
- Axe: “Isn’t there something you’re looking for that lead you to the library?”
- Axe: “What if I told you the reason you were lead to the library, and the reason you are the Savior, were *coincided*?”
- Mara: “Stop speaking in tongues already. What are you hiding from me! Tell me everything!”
- Axe: “Kid, if I knew all of the answers, I would tell you them. But I know nothing about you or your personal life or, heck, even about *myself.* I’m just saying that going on the journey of the Savior will give you every answer about yourself that you could ever ask for. And in the end, isn’t that what every traveler is seeking?”
- Mara: “I’m not *seeking* to save the world, I’m just seeking to… Find a place to live a quiet and unbothered life.”

> Seth seeing Mara tell the axe very private details about herself (that she hasn’t told anyone but him) makes him feel uneasy and maybe even a bit angry that the Axe coaxed this information out of her.

- Axe: “And maybe that’s where our journey leads. For all we know, it might be 10 years until the final encounter, and in that time, you could probably lead a very meaningful, fulfilling life. You never know unless you *try.*”
- Mara: “…”
- Axe: “Well, there is no denying fate, kid. You can try all you want, but the Savior’s Journey is a fact of prophecy. The ways it might occur might be different in nature, but it’s still all *true.* It’s just your choice whether you want to spend the journey locked up in a prison, or on a quest throughout the continents.”
- Mara: “A fact… of prophecy.”
- Axe: “It’s true! Look, kid, I hate to spring this on you—well actually I don’t. It’s my role as the remnant of the 12 Gods. I need to guide you on the right path so that you might not experience as much as pain and suffering on your journey. But it’s your choice whether to accept my advice, or reject it.”
- Mara scoffs while staring at the floor. 
- Axe: “And, to answer your question from earlier… It would probably be the end of human life as we know it.”
- Mara looks sick. MC stands by her side while warily eyeing the axe. 

> Seth knows. 
> Mara doesn’t need to know about her aunt or her family; she was never too invested in either of those anyways. 
> Mara is a perpetual wanderer, someone who tried to run away from the orphanage without him. Someone who wants to find a place that fits her but struggles to accept the world for what it is. So for her to embrace it, even save it, is unthinkable.
> This was Mara’s journey, but for Seth’s reasons.  

- Mara: “…”
- Mara: “… Fine.”
- Mara: “I will do this, but on one condition.”
- Mara: “My identity as the Savior will be a secret to everyone, before and after the ordeal.”
- Axe: “Fine by me. You can change your mind about it whenever you want, by the way—in case you’re craving fame.”
- Mara: “Don’t kid me. ”
- Axe: “Right, right… Have it your way.”

> Seth is out of words. How can he respond to the situation unveiling in front of his eyes? From what he knows of Monaukan religion, horrible and incredible things await his sister, on her journey as the savior. 
> But he can’t just let this happen without intervening. So he speaks up.

- MC: “Hey… Axe. What do I call you?”
- Axe: “Just Axe is fine.”
- MC: “I’m coming with her. She’s my sister and I can’t let her go alone.”
- Mara: “Seth, no. You should just… You should just stay in Naunapocia. You *like* it here.”
- MC: “Sure, it’s great here, but I’m NOT letting you go on a journey across the country by yourself. What brother would I be if I let you do that by yourself?”
- Axe: “My two cents— I approve! Having companions would greatly help you on your journey. Saving the world is never a one-person ordeal!”
- Mara: “Well, I don’t. Seth,” she grabs Seth by the shoulders, “You can’t go with me.”
- MC: “Again with this crap, Mara? First you try to leave the orphanage, now you try to leave me in Naunapocia—”
- Mara: “That’s different. *This* is different.”
- Axe: “Alright, break it up, you two. My final say—he comes along with you. You need the extra pair of hands, Mara.”
- Mara: “Who said you could call me that?”
- Axe: “Oh, my apologies. Is there another name you’d prefer to go by?”
- Mara: “Ugh… Okay. Stop this clownery. Seth, we will talk later. You, get back in the box and shut up. We don’t need you interfering in our conversations.”
- Axe: “Hey, wait—”

> Mara forcefully grabs the axe in her two hands and it seems to “power off”. She stuffs it in the black box, silencing it. 

- Mara: “I’m going to the market. Alone.”
- MC: “Okay, do your thing, Mara. Just don’t *leave me behind* in Naunapocia again.”

## Later at Night

- MC: “Back from the market?”
- Mara nods, groceries in hand. 
- MC: “Well, what’s for dinner?”
- Mara: “Wraps.”
- MC: “We should talk over dinner.”
- Mara: “Sure.”

> The two sit and eat dinner. 

- Mara: “You know I’m just worried for your safety.”
- MC: “Worried for *me*? ”
- Mara: “Seth, you… You don’t understand. You know the reason we’re not starving here? Because I worked part-time when we were at the orphanage, saving up money for my future travels. I know how the world works. I’m *capable* of doing this all by myself.”
- MC: “So you’re saying that I’m dragging you down.”
- Mara: “Well, yes, but…” *Mara lets out a deep sigh.* “No, not really.”
- MC: “… You’re the one who was hospitalized for the first 10 years of your life; what’s going to happen if you’re in battle and you have an episode? It’ll be game over!”
- Mara: “The savior’s not supposed to die before they get a chance to fight against the Essence of Eff, Seth. I have until then to *live*. But you don’t have that insurance, Seth.”
- MC: “…”
- MC: “… I guess that’s true.” 
- MC: “But, how do I put this, Mara…”
- MC: “If that Axe is telling the truth about this “Savior” thing, and you’re saying that you want to go on the Savior’s Journey by yourself…“
- MC: “Then, this will be the last time I ever see you.”

> Mara understands what Seth is getting at. She knows he has trouble articulating some of his feelings, especially when talking about some more difficult subjects. 
> This would be the last time they’d ever see each other. And sure, when she was back at the orphanage, she had accepted the fact that she would have to leave Seth behind. But now things had changed. Their relationship at the orphanage had been weak, but on the 8-months journey since then, the two had grown closer and closer. And she was no longer willing to leave Seth behind.  

- Mara: “I understand that.”
- Mara: “And I’ve already told you about the risks. Not going to say them again.”
- Mara: “Even so, you’re still willing to go on the journey with me?”
- MC: “Of course I am!”
- Mara: “Then I’ll let you come with me. However, on one condition.”
- MC: “Mara, you and your conditions…”
- Mara: “That I get to tell you what to do whenever I feel like it, and you have to do as I say.”
- MC: “… I’m staying in Naunapocia.”
- Mara: “Going once… Going twice…”
- Mara: ”Gone. Okay, bye Seth.” *Mara stands up from the table and pretends to leave.*
- Seth pretends to cry. When Mara looks back at Seth in digust, he shoots her a stink eye. 
- Mara laughs to herself. The air is still tense, but the siblings feel better about their situation now.
