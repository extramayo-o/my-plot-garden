> The door of the library flaps in the wind. The latch is clearly broken. 

- Mara: “Gah! Here—take this. Wedge it against the door.”

> Mara hands Seth a large dictionary and continues to dig through the library.

- MC: “Mara, the old man left. We don’t have to listen to him anymore.”
- Mara: “Who knows, there might be another crony who’ll take his place and start babbling. Better keep the door closed.”

> Seth lodges the book behind the door, grumbling about how hot and miserable it is without air circulation. 

> While Mara is still at work, Seth takes a break to look at Mara.  

- MC: “Mara. Remind me why we have to do this again.”
- Mara: “Do what.”
- MC: “Go through an entire library’s worth of dusty old geneology records.”
- Mara: “Because one of those records has our Aunt’s name in it. And if we find that, we can find our family.”
- MC: “…“
- MC: “Mara, I can’t even read… Man, I don’t know why you asked me to come. I could’ve slept early tonight…” 
- Mara: “Come on, you said you were the one who wanted to do this in the first place. Take some responsibility, Seth. At least flip open the pages for me…”

> MC doesn’t listen to Mara and wanders around the dark library. Mara is too busy looking through a thick family tree book to respond. 

> The MC knocks over a dusty vase with cobwebs lining from it to the wall. 

- MC: “Ack!”
- Mara: “Hey, Seth! Stop digging around and get to work! Did you forget, we’re not supposed to be here!”
- MC: “I won’t be your pageboy!”
- Mara: “That’s not what the word means, idiot!”
- MC: “I don’t ca— Ouch!”

> The MC trips over a large black box covered in cobwebs. It was positioned behind the vase and a stack of dusty old books. 

- MC: *It looks so out of place here…*

> Seth glides his fingers on the black box, wiping the cobwebs away. It is cold to the touch and sleek. Though it’s hard to see the design in the dark, Seth’s pretty sure he’s never seen anything like it in all of Naunapocia.

- MC: *What could be inside?*

> Seth tries to open the box, but it seems to be fused shut. Frustrated, he sets it back on the floor, only to pick it back up again. 

- Mara: “Had a nice break now? My candle’s starting to run out… I’d appreciate it if someone got me a new one.”
- MC: “If you open this box for me, then I’ll get back to work.”
- Mara: “How about you get back to work anyways.”

> But at the same time, the MC sets the box on top of Mara’s book. She grumbles but acquiesces. 

- Mara: “Ugh. Fine. I’ll open it for you.”

> Mara opens the box, which unlatches open with ease. 

- Mara: “… You couldn’t open this, Seth? Come on.”
- MC: “That’s weird… maybe I opened it wrong.”
- Mara: “Yeah, maybe. Wait—gah!”

> As Mara lifts up the lid to the box, a yellow light, bright as the sun, floods out of the covers along with a gust of wind surrounding the box. The two hold their arms against their eyes to avoid the glare of the box, which quickly floods the dark room. Mara yells incomprehensibly while Seth tries to peak out of his fingers and get a look at the box.

- Mara: “Can you stop it with your immature jokes already, Seth? This one’s gone too far!”
- MC: “I don’t know what’s going on!”
- Mara: “…”

> And the light stops, suddenly, letting the two come back to their senses. 

> Seth walks over to the box. On the inside of the box is an unintelligible glyph, a mess of characters. But, the box is empty, leaving a golden insignia visible at its bottom.

- Mara: “Okay, Seth. You got me good. Now, quit it with your pranks or I’m leaving you behind in this country for good.”
- MC: “No, no. Here—just look at this.”

> Mara approaches the box cautiously, awaiting another prank from Seth, but nothing comes.

- Mara: “What is *that?*”
- MC: “Uh, I think it’s a scale? Like, the symbol of the Family of Justice.“
- Mara: “No, Seth… the text. It says…”

> Seth can’t read novels or paragraphs, but he can read regular Monaukan and Naunapocian just fine. And the script on the top of the box is entirely foreign to him. So why, he wonders, can Mara read the script? 

- Mara: “With this weapon, I cleave the bondage of oppression and deliver Justice to the wronged…”
- Mara: “Uh… Seth? You didn’t do this, right?”

> Seth’s face turns pale. Before he gets a chance to speak, the bright light materializes again, but this time Mara doesn’t protect her face. Through the cracks of his fingers again, Seth can see a wide-eyed Mara basking in the bright light, mumbling to herself silently and frantically. 

- MC: “MARA!”

> Seth reaches out for Mara, who mutters incomprehensibly. 

> Soon enough, the light fades. The text on the top of the lid disappears, and what’s left of the script is the echo of Mara’s words. The box glows gently one last time, and a weapon materializes inside of the box, filling up the empty space. 

> Mara falls to her knees. 

- MC: “MARA! Are you okay?”

> Mara’s muttering comes to a stop.

- Mara: “… Seth.”
- MC: “Yeah. I’m here.”

> Mara takes Seth’s hand and, unsteadily, stands up. 

- Mara: “Seth, I…”
- Mara: “I had this voice in my head… It kept on telling me that I was the savior, meant to rescue the people of this land…”
- MC: “NO! That— That doesn’t make any sense. 
- Mara: “E-exactly. I’m sure it was just nonsense and that we’re just very tired tonight… We should leave.”
- MC: “Right… Let’s go to sleep.”

> The lid is slammed shut on the weapon, and the twins leave the library in a frenzy.
