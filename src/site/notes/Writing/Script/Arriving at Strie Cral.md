## Terminal S 

- At: “Please hand in your tickets for Terminal S, please.”

> The twins enter a compartment within a train-shaped object and close the door tightly. 

- Mara: “I’ve read about this in books… The train is coated with Eff. That’s how it moves in the air so fast.”
- MC: “Eff? But isn’t it harmful to humans…”
- Mara: “It’s in low concentration; it won’t hurt us. Anyways, the conductor of the train is an Eff user, and they animate the Eff so that the train is weightless. Isn’t that cool?”
- MC: “No, it sounds terrifying. What’s stopping us from hitting our heads on the train walls, anyways?”
- Mara: “That’s why you have to use the seatbelts here.”

> Mara clicks in Seth’s seatbelt and the two sit opposite from each other. The train departs the terminal and flies in the sky like a jet engine.  

- MC: “Mara… I feel sick.”
- Mara: “I read about this in a book too! It’s called motion sickness.”
- MC: “Can you stop making stuff up? Ughhh…”
- Mara: “There, there.”

> Mara pats Seth on the back. He does get better with time. 

- MC: “This isn’t so bad…”
- Mara: “But your face is so pale.”
- MC: “No, no… I mean, being without the stupid talking axe.”
- Mara: “… I get what you mean.”
- Mara: “… I wish it was more helpful.”
- MC: “I wish this never happened to you.”
- Mara: “Seth…”
- MC: “… Just so you know, I’m not giving up on the possibility that the axe could be lying. It doesn’t *have* to be you.” 
- Mara: “… Seth, I’ve been hearing voices inside of my head since that day in the library. Telling me that I’m the Savior, that I must draw the ritual blade against myself, that the fate of humanity lies in my hands…”
- Mara: “So while I might hope that the Oracle says something else… I think it’s pretty certain that I *am* the savior.”
- MC: “And you’re okay with that?”
- Mara: “No! Absolutely not. I don’t feel like it’s any of my business *at all*.”
- MC: “… Okay. I won’t get my hopes up.”
- Mara: “Don’t give up, Seth.” 
- Mara: “Like the axe said… I could still live a long, meaningful life before doing my role as the savior. Who knows, maybe in 60 years, I might find the world worth saving.”
- MC: “But now, you don’t.”
- Mara: “I don’t. I don’t want to be the savior.”
- MC: “Isn’t that wonderful!”
- Mara: “Haha. Just don’t tell Axy about it, okay? I don’t want another long-winded lecture on how it’s my responsibility to save humankind.”

> Seth nods and Mara nods back.

- MC: “I think I’m going to get some shut-eye for the rest of the ride. I’m so exhausted.”

> Seth sleeps for the rest of the ride. 

> With one last acceleration, the train rushes downwards, and the two arrive at their destination soon after. 

## Strie Cral

>The train arrives and the passengers pour out of the compartments. Most of them are businesspeople, scholars, or some other form of adult. 

> Mara and Seth also leave the compartment and look vaguely lost.

- Mara: “We’re here.”

> The two look at their destination. It’s the top of a hill overlooking the capital city of Strie Cral, which has several large, spiked white buildings stretched across the backdrop of the ocean towards the south. Carriages, engines, and ziplines bring passengers down the side of the hill, and there is a single long winding staircase leading everyone else back into the city. 

- MC: “I’ve missed seeing the sea!”
- Mara: “It’s the Southern sea, not the Northern sea. Think it looks any different?”
- MC: “They have beaches here.”
- Mara: “Hmm.”

> The two turn to the zipline ticket booth and Mara is asked to pay the ticket fee.  

- Mara: “Errr…”
- MC: “Mara, are we out of money?”
- Mara: “… Well, it’s not like that. But… I’m sorry, I’ve changed my mind. Thank you for your time.”

> The two turn away from the 

- Mara: “We’re taking the stairs.”
- MC: “That’s fine. How come you changed your mind?”
- Mara: “Daylight robbery. The cost of the service was more than the train ride itself… How could anyone pay that?”
- MC: “Well, it’s probably because…” *He gestures at the long staircase that awaits them. It stretches on and on until it disappears from view. Nobody else is taking this route.*
- Mara: “Ah.”
- MC: “Let’s alternate carrying the axe box.”
- Mara: “Smartest thing you’ve ever said”, she said, handing the box over to Seth. 

>By nighttime Mara and Seth have arrived at a village on the outskirts of Strie Cral’s capital. However, the entire village is silent. The houses are cold and white and foreboding, and there are hardly any signs around the village. There wasn’t a single house with a light turned on. If it weren’t for the large glowing light in the center of the capital, the city would have effectively looked like a ghost town. 

- MC: “Is it *really* that late?”
- Mara: “I think they have a curfew.”
- MC: “…”

> The two look around for some sort of shelter in the village, heading inwards toward the city. 

- Mara: “You know, there’s a stereotype about Cralians.”
- MC: “What is it?”
- Mara: “They’re weird, basically. They live by a unique set of rules, they’re super religious, they don’t have their own birthdays, but rather celebrate one *singular* birthday when the year changes.”
- MC: “But they have the Oracle.”
- Mara: “Yeah. I think it’s *because* the country is home to the last-remaining Minor God, that they’re so weird like that.”
- MC: “Huh. I guess their weirdness makes sense, then. They’re kind of entitled to it…”
- Mara: “Maybe, maybe not.”

> A wagon lead by a horse wanders through the street, and a bright light shines on Mara and Seth’s faces. 

- Soldier: “Halt! Show your faces!”

> The two drop their hoods and reveal their faces, on instinct.

> The soldier brandishes his sword at the two of them. He’s just 3 seconds away from lopping off Seth’s head.

- Soldier: “What are you two foreigners doing here in this village?”

> Mara’s hands tighten on the box, but she calms down and manages to respond to the soldier. 

- Mara: “We just came here from the stone path. Did we do something wrong?”
- Soldier: “…”
- Soldier: “So you two are the strange foreigners I have been called to.”
- MC: “Called to?”
- Soldier: “In any case, you can’t stay here. Your fate is not to stay here overnight.”
- Mara: “Really?”
- Soldier: “They have declared that today be a peaceful night. I shall take you to the capital city, but our fates diverge from there.”
- MC: “Sounds good.”

> The two board the carriage and head towards the bright light in the epicenter of the city. Mara writes in her pocket diary: *Strie Cral is unfriendly to visitors*
