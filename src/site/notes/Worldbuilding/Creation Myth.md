#worldbuilding #setup

1. Eff has always been present in the world. In the core of the planet is the <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Essence of Eff</mark>, which has always existed. — <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">*Note to self— needs a better name than that.* </mark>
2. **Primitive Eff** enters bodies of physical nature. Eff gains a Sentience if highly concentrated or well-integrated. 
3. With several thousands of years of evolution, **Gods** were formed. They were humanlike beings made of Eff itself, and were sentient beings able to make their own decisions. They could wield Eff like second nature and bend it to their will— a blessing given to them by the Essence of Eff.  They had physical bodies as well.  
4. Gods used their Eff to “liven” the world, creating the species of the land. Including humans. Humans were considered to be a mistake, and their existence was a slight against the will of the EoE. 
	1. Too dominant against other species, threatening the balance/**equilibrium** of the world. 
		1. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">That could be Eff’s trait. </mark>
	2. Species extinction exists in this universe (Dinosaurs real!)
	3. There is no verbal or visual contact with the EoE; it just is. It’s just there. Until the Gods come down to visit it. 
5. The Gods defended humans against extinction. They saw humankind’s potential and ability to be kind/caring.
6. SOO, the Gods fought against the evil of the world, killing off the horrible Sentences that opposed them. Eventually the EoE comes out to fight them in physical form (moving bundle of highly concentrated Eff in solid, liquid, and gas form, with volcanic/lava powers). And the Gods are wiped out. 
7. But due to a “glitch in the program” or underestimated Sentience (Vengeance), the Essence of Eff is defeated.
