## First Round

Context: the 12 (only because it’s a nice number) Gods that fight against Eff to protect the human race. 

The gang either (I’ve decided now):

1. Discovers a spell to enchant a weapon; 
2. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Finds a material with anti-Eff properties, that can be made into a weapon</mark>; 

that has the ability “scatter” Eff and make it less concentrated, therefore making it hard for the Eff to fill the consciousness of anything. 

They cannot use a weapon embedded with this with too much strength, or for a very long amount of time, or else their consciousness will become too scattered. After all, they are made of Eff itself, so using the weapon for too long/with too much intensity would effectively just **kill them.**

(But the reason they can use the weapon at ALL is because humans help fashion/enchant the weapon so that they can use it in short bursts. Yay cooperation!)

### Battle

Four of the more combat-oriented Gods attack the EoE; the others play support. 

### Defeat

Despite their efforts, the Gods can’t defeat the EoE and are wiped out. I mean their whole squad is killed.  

But in a desperate move, Vengeance puppeteers the bodies of the fallen (all four in one coordinated strike), launching one final, devastating attack against the Essence of Eff. Its consciousness splits into a million different pieces and falls back onto the world <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">as rain</mark>.

Vengeance cannot “puppeteer” [[Worldbuilding/Vessels\|vessels]] of the living: only the dead, or objects. As the dead bodies of the Gods <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">“melt” onto their weapons and harden</mark>, Vengeance becomes one with the four weapons, but mostly the one that dealt the final blow. 

#### Ideas

- I think it would be cool if Vengeance had a twin named Justice, and Justice “dealt” the final blow.
- Rain is pure Eff. Humans can’t tolerate high doses of Eff.  
- ! But humans have an umbrella now/protected successfully! — like a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">“*promise*” made to humankind</mark>, that they must live by these virtues and strive to make a world a better place.  
	- But, according to the mainline story, **this is far from the truth.**

## Second Round

> This part is more important to the immediate story. 
> How have humans prophesized that the savior of the world will defeat the EoE against the second coming?

- Things change the second time around. 
- ! This time, it is prophesized that the way to defeat the EoE is to freeze it in time permanently. This would seal the EoE in a chamber at the center of the world, along with the savior, keeping human beings safe from Eff forever. 
- The remaining amount of Eff in the atmosphere would not be able to circulate, therefore cutting off Eff from the world forever. 

### False Hope? 

- What gives Seth and Mara false hope is the belief that *the world can be saved via method 1.* That maybe, they can assemble all of the weapons and defeat the EoE that way.
