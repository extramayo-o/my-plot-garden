## First Round

Context: the 12 (only because it’s a nice number) Gods that fight against Eff to protect the human race. 

The gang either (I’ve decided now):

1. Discovers a spell to enchant a weapon; 
2. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Finds a material with anti-Eff properties, that can be made into a weapon</mark>; 

that has the ability “scatter” Eff and make it less concentrated, therefore making it hard for the Eff to fill the consciousness of anything. 

They cannot use a weapon embedded with this with too much strength, or for a very long amount of time, or else their consciousness will become too scattered. After all, they are made of Eff itself, so using the weapon for too long/with too much intensity would effectively just **kill them.**

(But the reason they can use the weapon at ALL is because humans help fashion/enchant the weapon so that they can use it in short bursts. Yay cooperation!)

### Battle

Four of the more combat-oriented Gods attack the EoE; the others play support. 
### Defeat

Despite their efforts, the Gods can’t defeat the EoE and are wiped out. 

But in a desperate move, Vengeance puppeteers the bodies of the fallen (all four in one coordinated strike), launching one final, devastating attack against the Essence of Eff. Its consciousness splits into a million different pieces and falls back onto the world <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">as rain</mark>.
