1. Axe of Judgement
	1. An axe with a “mind of its own”—aka a moral compass—embedded into the weapon itself. Which means that the special feature of this weapon is that it is sentient. The other four weapons cannot talk and deliver advice, although they are still “animated” and do have “minds of their own”. 
2. Tome of Sacrifice
	1. A book with impossible spells at impossible prices. Including, contact with the Essence of Eff itself. 
	2. See [[Writing/Script/Obtaining the Tome of Sacrifice\|Obtaining the Tome of Sacrifice]] for more information.
3. Sword of Loyalty
	1. [See colors of flames.](https://fireplaceadviser.com/flame-color-temperature-chart/)
	2. A sword that burns with violet-colored flames. Melts the earth itself.
4. Lance of Unity
	1. A lance that rallies armies. But, it also animates Eff into soldiers that the user can command at their will.
