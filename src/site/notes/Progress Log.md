- **8/6**: Came up with ending, conceptualized +20 more scenes 
- **8/7**: Fiddling with vault. A lot of work on the [[Middle.canvas|Middle]] sections of the story—especially some extra attention to [[Characters/Nima\|Nima]]
- **8/8**: A lot of work was done! I added more [[Meta/Antagonists\|antagonists]], planned out character development events for [[Characters/Seth\|Seth]] and [[Characters/Mara\|Mara]], and elaborated on events I have planned for the story. God bless Longform.

## Plotting Phase: To-Do

- [x] Finish characterizing [[(Old) Nima\|(Old) Nima]]
	- [x] Append new scenes for him 
- [ ] More/better lore for [[Worldbuilding/Families\|Families]]
	- Elaborate on their abilities maybe? 
	- No worries- this will be done **naturally**, especially with the fourth arc of the story. 
- [ ] More/better lore for [[Worldbuilding/Political/Countries\|Countries]]
- [x] Elaborate on [[Meta/Antagonists\|Antagonists]]— this is something I’m uncertain of. 

___

- [ ] Final Quality Check
	- [ ] Smooth out countries— [[Map v1.png]]
	- [ ] Finish character profiles— mostly just [[Characters/Mara\|Mara]] and [[Characters/Seth\|Seth]] but others too
