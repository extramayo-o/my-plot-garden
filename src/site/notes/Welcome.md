I’m using this Digital Garden to publish my Worldbuilding/Plotting shenanigans.

Mostly just for my friends’ eyes but I guess the general public gets to see this too. 

I’m only working on one writing project right now: see [[Plotting Details\|Plotting Details]] for more information.

## Why Publish? 

- It looks cool. 
- I get to share it with friends. 
- I love making the most out of Obsidian!

## Highlight Schema

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Orange</mark>: revisit later  
- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Gray</mark>: Introducing an acronym
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Red</mark>: Needs correction/was corrected.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Yellow</mark>: Important!
